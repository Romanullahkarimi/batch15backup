operators:
Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operation line addition,subtraction
we can compere thhings if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other or not .
there are thee main types of operators. They are artihmetic,relational operators, and logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:
we use arithemtic operators to perform simple math operation . like  additions,subtraction
+ =>addition
- =>subraction
/ => devision
* => mutiplication
% => modulus,rminder

relational operators:
relational operators are used to compare or entities . for example if somthing id bigger than others of
if two nambers are same or not  if same two boolean variables contian sanme values or not.
== => used to check if two variables contian the same values or not if same we get true otherwie we get false.
!= => used to check if two variales dont contain  the same values . we get a true if they are not same.
> => used to check if one values is greater than other values or not  if greater we get  a true.
 < => used to check if th values on the left is smaller than the values on right side we will get a true.
 >= =>  if the values on left side  is greater than the value on right side or if they ARE GET A TRUE
 <= => it opposite of => and its used to check if somethings less than or equal to others thing.


 conditional constucts:
 used to write conditional code . a piece of code that execte based on conditon .if condition is true that jave
 execute the code oterwise it skips that code.
 how to write ifsles conditions:
 if (condition)
 {
 any line of code
 }
 if(){
 any another if condition
 }
 1:for string we use equal method instead of == sign becouas its a s non permitive data type
 2: we can cmd+opt+1(Mac) crtl +alt+L(windowas)to format our code
 3: if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing parts to check other parts
