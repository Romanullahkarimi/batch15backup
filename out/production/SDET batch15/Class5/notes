 we can use to combine multipale boolean value

        logical operator only use for boolean value. not for String,char
        ,int.
         operation operators: !()not ||(or) &&(and)
         ! if something is true it will make it false and false make it true

         || or condition say if one condition is true all result is ture

         && and condition only true all the condition is true

         why should we learn logical operators?
         we greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

         what is the syntax?

          they only work with bolean data type
          if (! condtion)
          if condtion1 || condtion 2)
          if condition1 && condition2)


what is switchcase condition?

its work like ifElseIf condition
 it's very fast

1) we can only use byte short int char string
 2)we can't  use  double float long
 3)we can't use relatinal operators in switch case
