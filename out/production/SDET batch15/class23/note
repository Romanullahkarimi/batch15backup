Method overriding:
   Method-overriding happens when same method with different implementation exists in parent and child class.
Why should we override a method:
   1) Flexibility. => When we inherit from a class and if we do not like some methods we can modify them.
Rules:
   1) Private methods and constructors can not be overridden because they do not participate in inheritance.
   2) If we want to override something, we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and have a different implementations.
   3) The only change we can make is increasing the visibility in comparison to the parent class.
