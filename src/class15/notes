Methods in java:
is collection of java statements and block of code like if else ,loop
Why should we learn about methods:
   1)   it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them.
      for them bulid those methods one by one and later on combine them to built the complete application.
      2)methods allows us to re-use code
      3) methods allows us to be flexible
                  how can we create Methods?
                  there are two types built-in and user defined methods.
                  build-in methods?
                  the methods which are designed for java developers for examle the println() nextInt() methods in the
                  Scanner class length() present in string class they are built-in methods.

                 user defined methods?
                 the methods that we write.
                 methods which return something when callad and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

Rules :
return type and the value that we are returning from a method should match
 we can only assign methods to variables of same types.
